# Image-To-Ascii
A special Shell that allows to convert a color image to a black-and-white image made in an Ascii format. 
The SHELL allows the user to increase/decrease the resolution, control the set of Ascii characters that will be involved and more.

Example - as you remember, 2020 was not an easy year at all for all of us,
because the new year is upon us, get a joke and a reminder of how bad 2020
was (true, it has been a year since but 2020 will be remembered forever).

For the next Input Image:

We will get the next output Image, Ascii Image with resolution of 500 pixels:
